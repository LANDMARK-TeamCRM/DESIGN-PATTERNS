BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS FOR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 


Here’s how the 11 behavioral design patterns can be applied to a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system:

### 1. Chain of Responsibility
**Usage**: To handle customer requests and queries. Each handler (e.g., support, sales, technical) processes the request or passes it along the chain.

### 2. Command
**Usage**: To encapsulate customer actions (like placing an order or updating information) as command objects. This allows for undo/redo features and queuing actions.

### 3. Interpreter
**Usage**: To interpret customer queries or commands. For instance, allowing customers to use natural language to search for information or generate reports.

### 4. Iterator
**Usage**: To iterate through collections of customers or interactions. This enables displaying customer lists or transaction histories seamlessly.

### 5. Mediator
**Usage**: To manage communication between different modules (e.g., sales, marketing, support) within the CRM, reducing dependencies and promoting loose coupling.

### 6. Memento
**Usage**: To save the state of customer records. This allows for restoring previous states of customer data, such as reverting changes made during an update.

### 7. Observer
**Usage**: To notify users (like sales representatives) of changes in customer status or interactions (e.g., when a customer opens an email or makes a purchase).

### 8. State
**Usage**: To manage the various states of a customer (e.g., new, active, inactive). This allows the system to behave differently based on the customer’s state.

### 9. Strategy
**Usage**: To define different marketing strategies for customer engagement. For example, the system could switch between email marketing, SMS, or social media strategies based on customer preferences.

### 10. Template Method
**Usage**: To define the skeleton of a process, such as customer onboarding, where the general steps are fixed but specific actions can vary based on customer type.

### 11. Visitor
**Usage**: To perform operations on customer data without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. For instance, generating reports that analyze customer behavior across different segments.

By applying these behavioral patterns, a CRM system can be made more flexible, maintainable, and responsive to user needs.
